It's poorly written and even more poorly optimized, 
so if you want to get at least partially smooth experience, set cpu cycles in dosbox settings to max

## Installation
    cd Tasm # Path to your tasm folder
    git clone https://github.com/4uf04eG/DOSSnake.git
    cp DOSSnake/RUN.BAT .
    
   Then run RUN.BAT at dosbox
